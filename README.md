# Eyelash extensions client management dashboard
Simple client management system for lash service clients.

## The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with: 
**php** and php coding standards, prepared statements and best practices.\
**SQL** database structure and do's & dont's!

## The app includes:
**Login & authentication** ( COMING SOON )\
**Dashboard** - See all clients, appointments per client and all appointments.\
**Client Records**
**Client Appointments**
**Image uploads** for before and after images of each service.\
**Past appointments** to see historical appointments per client.

Since this is a php website it can't be viewed on GitHub pages.\
You can see a screenshot of the dashboard in its current state here: https://jocodes01.github.io/lashApp/

**Side note:**
I'm doing ladies eyelash services as a side business whilst learning to code so this app will be very useful for me.\
And yes, I've made a few mistakes along the way whilst coding this app but I am learning by doing and not just copying code from AI. I definetly see the benefit of AI and am using it to help me but I learn some solid lessons from my own mistakes!
