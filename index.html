          <h2>Eyelash extensions client management app</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            I've created this as a php project to help me store my client data
            and before & after photos for each service.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can't view it on github as it is a php project so I've included
            a video and screenshot of its current state.
          </p>
          <br />
        </div>
        <video width="320" height="240" controls>
          <source src="video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
