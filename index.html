      <h2>Eyelash extensions client management app</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I've created this as a php project to help me store my client data and
        before & after photos for each service.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You can't view it on github as it is a php project so I've included a
        screenshot of its current visual state.
